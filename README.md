# Coding-Quiz
Coding Quiz - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Dynamic HTML created with JavaScript
* Score based on time remaining plus points for correct answers.

## Creating a coding quiz

* General Layout
    * Starting page with start button
        * Clicking on start button will bring up first question and start 30 second timer
    * First question
        * prompt correct or wrong when submit
        * brings up second question
        * up to 5 questions
    * Final quiz page (timer runs out or questions are answered)
        * Tells you the score
        * Asks for initials
        * scores are stored locally
    * Final page 
        * lists high scores from local storage
        * back button to start quiz over

## Remaining issues
* High Score button only works on final page - possible class issue
* High Score button will add the list on top of one displayed instead of reloading
* High Score alert (started function, but need to research placement)
* Correct/Incorrect displays seem delayed and seem out of sequence
* Clean up code
* Complete styling
